### About
-------------
This is a small project I made in Godot 4 as a sort of comeback. It's a remake of the old Snake game I made way back in Lua with Solar2D.<br>
It looks more appealing visually and is also better in terms of functionality. <br>

### Getting Started
-------------
To compile this project, you will need at least Godot v4.3. Do not forget you will need the required export templates. <br> 
More in-depth guide is avaiable here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html <br>
You're free to modify the project as you wish.

### Credits
-------------
Credits are listed in the Help menu. <br>
Thanks to Varga for testing. <br>
